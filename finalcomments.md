Unfortunately, the code didn't run on my machine. I got an encoding error from line 37.

# Comments
You had several line-by-line comments in order to give some understanding of your code, as well as an introductory comment for a function. I would have liked to have seen both more comments and more substance to each, but you have a good start here.

# Code Quality
You did well at keeping your code DRY. I'll also say that putting the quotes and descriptions in a separate file was a good touch that kept your code from clutter.

# Ambition
This is where it's hard to gauge the success of your project because the *why* of it is a bit tough. The random episode name generator was a nice touch, but it's hard for me to see what this project is saying about you or the world at large, which was one requirement of the project as a whole. The README was also a bit thin.
