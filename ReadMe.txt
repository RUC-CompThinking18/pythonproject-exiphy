The whole code is written in python 3. 
I used "https://rickandmortyapi.com/" for my code. 
Basically the code is requesting the given API for character info from a Random episode
that occured in Rick and Morty multiverse. It outputs a Randomly generated episode name with a 
funny description of the episode, it also prints a charcter from that episode with its name, status and \
location in the fictional multiverse. It also gives out a random quote from the TV show.
