Your code runs, which was the major requirement of this milestone. Now, the trick is expanding it: what more can this program do to be more interactive or engage with the world a bit more? Remember that this project is all about making something that comments on the world or yourself. Right now, acting as an interface to the Rick and Morty API is interesting, and I'm glad you were able to get it to work. Now, what can you do with that data that's interesting or informative? What can you show your user that they might not be able to see otherwise?
